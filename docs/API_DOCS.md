The Node Chat feature includes enhancements to the existing `/node/{graph_id}/{node_id}` endpoint, which now returns examples in its response, providing practical applications of the concept.

### Usage Example

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://localhost:5001/api/node-chat"
payload = {
    "node_id": "node_1",
    "graph_id": "67dbbafc3b11728551f5ce4c",
    "query": "How does this concept apply to healthcare organizations?",
    "document_id": "67dbac15ea53f25878bfa9fd"
}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

print(f"Response: {data['response']}")
print("\nExamples:")
for example in data['examples']:
    print(f"- {example['title']}: {example['description']}")

print("\nSuggested questions:")
for question in data['suggested_questions']:
    print(f"- {question}")
```

### Node Quiz

}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'Environment' in the St. Gallen Management Model?",

}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: Missing required fields or invalid request

## Implementation Notes

- The API processes queries asynchronously, so you must check the query status to determine when processing is complete
- Knowledge graphs are hierarchical with layers representing different levels of abstraction
- The context enrichment parameters significantly affect the content and structure of generated knowledge graphs
